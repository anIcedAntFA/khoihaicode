```

This project was created using `bun init` in bun v1.1.13. [Bun](https://bun.sh) is a fast all-in-one JavaScript runtime.

## 2.Programming Knowledge and know-hows

In past projects such as Borderless, Branding Site, I have learned and practiced my coding skills with libraries such as:

- How to build and divide the directory structure and architecture for a reactjs project from basic (app based page) to complex (app based feature).
- **Reactjs**: better understand it, design patterns such as Compound Pattern, HOC Pattern, Hooks Pattern, Container/Presentational Pattern, Render Props Pattern and apply in practice.
- **React Hook Form**: use advanced features, and best practices for optimization
- **Yup**: learn about it (previously mainly used Zod) and apply some advanced validation methods to meet project requirements.
- **Tanstack query** (React query): learn uses, how data is stored and shared, manage server state. Apply best practices to optimize code.
- **Pragmatic drag and drop**: Learn and learn how to drag and drop purely in javascript, making it more browser-friendly and optimized for performance. Research into drag and drop nested feature.
- Apply **recursive** to flatten nested array, render tree with nodes.
- **Community APIs**: First time getting acquainted and learning how to work with it.
- **Vitest**: Learn about testing, Javascript/Typescript unit testing
- Some others are **Material UI**, **Bun**,
